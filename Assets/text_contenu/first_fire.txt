To protect against fire,build a prefecture
(now available) near your housing.

The prefecture sends a citizen to walk around
and look for laborers.Once he walks past some
housing, the prefecture has access. Then, it can
send prefects out on patrol


When the prefect discovers a fire in his area,
he moves to douse the fire with buckets of
water.

You can right-click on rubble to learn what was
there before the fire. Once back on normal
patrol,the prefect inspects buildings on his
route for fire hazards, reducing their risk of
catching fire.

Prefects can provide their service to any
building within 2 spaces of the road
